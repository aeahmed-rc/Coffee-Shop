# Project: Barista Full Stack App

# Goal: Built a Full stack web app that allows a cashier to take and enter customer orders. The order is added to a queue that only the baristas have access to. The uncompleted orders are presented on the top of the screen and the completed orders are presented below. As an order is completed the customers order and name are called out.

# Technologies used:
# HTML, EJS, express, Node.js, css, MongoDB, User Authentication

## Installation

1. Clone repo
2. run `npm install`

## Usage

1. run `node server.js`
2. Navigate to `localhost:8080`

Reflection:
I would like to implement better CSS techniques , have the completed orders delete automatically from data base and only remain on screen only when the barista is logged in but once they login only the incompleted orders will show
